      <h2>Easy to Set Up and Vote</h2><br>
      <p>We make it super easy for our students to set an election and to cast their votes.</p><br>
      <p>When the election starts, each of the registered voter is allowed to secretly login. The voter then just clicks that link to be immediately taken to the voting page. Because our process is so easy for voters, we get a higher percentage of voters to actually vote.</p><br>
      <p>Our interface allows both regular (check box) voting and (drag and drop) ranked choice voting. You can try the voting interface in the example ballots that follow or by casting a vote in our demonstration poll.

      <p>Students love the clear and transparent results OpaVote will enable you to provide them with. At the end of your election, you'll get the raw ballots as well as a detailed report with counts automatically done for you. The step by step explanation of these counts are based on the voting method you used, and interactive graphics allow you can see the fine-grained details at each step.
